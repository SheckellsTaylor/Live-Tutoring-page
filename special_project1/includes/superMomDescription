TeachingToBeFriends.com has learned that not all children are given the best opportunity to make friends or how to make them. When a child is put in a situation and they donâ€™t know how to handle it, it can lead to anger, sadness even fear. Here at TeachingToBeFriends.com we are working to educate children on effective communication so that we can all get along and find ways to work together after we learn core communication principles.
